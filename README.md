## Abstract
Identifying fine cracks in steel bridge facilities is a challenging task of structural health monitoring (SHM). This study proposed an end-to-end crack image segmentation framework based on a one-step Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pixel-level object 
recognition with high accuracy. To particularly address the challenges arising from small object detection in complex backgrounds, efforts were made in loss function selection aiming at sample imbalance and module modification in order to improve the generalization 
ability on complicated images. Specifically, loss functions were compared among alternatives including the Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), Focal, Tversky and Dice loss, with the last three specialized for biased sample distribution. Structural modifications with dilated 
convolution, Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) were also performed to form a new backbone termed **CrackDet**. Models of various loss functions and feature extraction modules were trained on crack images and tested on full-scale images 
collected on steel box girders.
